# Maze solving 
Robots nowadays is a major component due to its ability to plan its path. You can program a robot for all possible motions in order to accomplish specific task. However, preprogramming a robot for all possible cases might meet is an impossible thing, due to the fact that number of motions can be an infinite loop or large number of motions. 
We will show you in this project the application of the Artificial Intelligent (search algorithm especially), robot path planning (e.g. A*) and how will it find its optimal path like humans and how they are able to see their obstacles and finding their optimal path in real life.
